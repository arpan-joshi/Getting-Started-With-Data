# Phase 2: Getting Started With Data

## 📌 Overview
This phase marks the beginning of applied programming. Moving away from abstract coding exercises, this module focuses on **"Thinking in Terms of Data."** I learned how to structure, clean, and derive value from raw datasets using a real-world e-commerce scenario.

## 📂 Project: Amazon Store Analysis
This module is centered around a case study of an Amazon Store dataset. The goal was to transform raw JSON data into actionable business insights and user features.

### 🛠️ Key Stages

#### 1. Data Setup & Cleaning
* **Thinking in Data:** Understanding how to model real-world entities as data structures.
* **JSON Setup:** Loading and parsing raw JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files.
* **Cleaning & Structuring:** Handling missing values, fixing inconsistent formatting, and organizing the data into a usable format for analysis.

#### 2. Meaningful Insights
* **Data Analysis:** Writing scripts to query the cleaned data.
* **Metric Extraction:** Calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
  * Top-selling categories.
  * Average product ratings.
  * Pricing trends.

#### 3. Feature Engineering: Recommendation System
* **Logic Implementation:** Building a logic-based recommendation engine.
* **Functionality:** Suggesting products to users based on criteria like "Frequently Bought Together" or "Similar Category/Price Range."
